  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Inspiring Software Engineer</em></p>
  <p>My name is Andrew Vuong and I am a junior at UC Davis majoring in Cognitive Science.
    Using the skills I learned from programs I joined, my goal is to become a Software Engineer or IT specialist who will help others by fixing whatever problems they might be having and analyzing their needs to improve their everyday life. To achieve this goal, I want to impact and influence others around me by helping them with their school life and as a bonus make connections along the way. To do this I am practicing my leadership skills and using my empathy to be able to understand the problems they are facing and figure out a good solution that best suits the current situation. By being a software engineer or IT specialist in the future, I can continue to use empathy to help make others happy and well if they are struggling with a problem. The reason why mental health for me is important is that my friends had anxiety and issues before, and through the process of helping them through the way, I donâ€™t want others to face the horror and pain of being alone, so that is why I try my best to help others in need. 
    Some fun facts about me: I love boba, do swimming and dragonboat, love to hike and have a dog named Mochi. I am in a family of four and have a younger sister</p>
